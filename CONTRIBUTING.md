## Improving current RPM spec files
Most RPM spec files can be improved. Small improvements like adding licenses with the `%license` or `%doc` files in `%files` section, splitting up packages, adding docs/manpages, adding Ubuntu patches that may help, etc. This should be less of an issue over time.

## Adding RPM spec files
Before adding RPM spec files in a pull request, they **must** be related to Unity or mostly any packages in this repository.
