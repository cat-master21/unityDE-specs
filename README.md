# Unity(X) Shell Fedora RPMs

This repository contains all the RPM spec files needed for
Unity(X) shell which had only been done [once before a long time ago](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/Unity-for-Fedora). This uses [UnityX](https://unityd.org) ([source code](https://gitlab.com/ubuntu-unity/unity-x)) and [Unity7.7](https://unityd.org) ([source code](https://gitlab.com/ubuntu-unity/unity/unity)) which are forks maintained by [Ubuntu Unity](https://ubuntuunity.org/). This is tested and used on the latest stable version of Fedora.

**Currently Unity7.7 and Unityx can't boot but contributions to make this happen is appreciated!**
